 Inspired by a [recent news story](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/08/ai-wins-state-fair-art-contest-annoys-humans/) and an episode of the [Cortex podcast](https://www.relay.fm/cortex/133), I made the below presentation to present to my friends and colleagues informally at a social meeting of the PhD students and postdocs in my department/institute at HVL.
