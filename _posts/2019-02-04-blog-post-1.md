 <!--  Presented in the document below is a concise summary of the methodology used to fit a circle to any three 2D Cartesian points (non-collinear and distinct), determining its radius and center, and its relation to the curvature of a portion of a curve consisting of those three points.  Explicit equations solely dependent on the coordinates of the three points are provided for all of these quantities too.  Functions written in Python to calculate these values are also provided. -->

<b><i>Abstract:</i></b> This work succinctly details the procedures involved in determining the curvature of three arbitrary two-dimensional points and the radius and center of the circle which circumscribes the triangle formed by these points.  Explicit equations solely a function of the Cartesian coordinates of the three points are provided for these values.

A circle can be fit to any three distinct and non-collinear Cartesian points $F$, $G$, and $H$ with coordinates of $(x_1,y_1)$, $(x_2,y_2)$, and $(x_3,y_3)$, respectively.  Non-collinearity can be proven in a variety of ways.  Since the area of the triangle formed by these three points will prove useful later, it can be calculated now, and a non-zero area proves the non-collinearity of the triplet of points.

Here, the Shoelace formula (also known as Gauss's area formula and the surveyorâ€™s formula [1]) can be employed for the $n=3$ case (where $n$ is the polygon's number of sides or vertices) to find the area of the triangle as shown in Equation \eqref{eq:shoelace}; note that $x_{n+1}$ and $y_{n+1}$ are equal to $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively.  This result can be negative depending on the ordering of the points; the absolute value in the last step has been added to prevent this here.

<p>
\begin{align}
A & = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^{3}
\begin{vmatrix}
x_i & x_{i+1} \\
y_i & y_{i+1}
\end{vmatrix}
= \frac{1}{2} \left(
\begin{vmatrix}
x_1 & x_{2} \\
y_1 & y_{2}
\end{vmatrix}
+
\begin{vmatrix}
x_2 & x_{3} \\
y_2 & y_{3}
\end{vmatrix}
+
\begin{vmatrix}
x_3 & x_{1} \\
y_3 & y_{1}
\end{vmatrix}
\right) \notag\\
& = \frac{1}{2} \left(
x_1 y_2 - x_2 y_1 + x_2 y_3 - x_3 y_2 + x_3 y_1 - x_1 y_3 \right) \notag\\
\lvert A \rvert & = \frac{1}{2} \lvert(x_2-x_1)\cdot(y_3-y_2)) - ((y_2-y_1)\cdot(x_3-x_2)\rvert
\label{eq:shoelace}
\end{align}

The circle which circumscribes a triangle is called the circumcircle [2].  Here, the side lengths opposite the vertices $F$, $G$, and $H$ will be denoted by the same letters in lowercase: $f$, $g$, and $h$, respectively. The circumcircle's radius $R$ can be found using Equation \eqref{eq:circumradius} [3,4].


\begin{equation}
R = \frac{fgh}{4A}
\label{eq:circumradius}
\end{equation}

These side lengths can be calculated using the Cartesian distance formula (Table 1) and then plugged back into Equation \eqref{eq:circumradius} alongside the triangle's area from Equation \eqref{eq:shoelace} to obtain the radius $R$ in terms of only the original three points' coordinates as shown in Equation \eqref{eq:circumradius-v2}.

<div style="text-align:center">Table 1: Triangle side lengths</div>

| Segment    | Name | Length |
| -------- | ----------- | ------------- |
| $\overline{FG}$	|	$h$	|	$\sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2+(y_2-y_1)^2}$ |
| $\overline{GH}$	|	$f$	|	$\sqrt{(x_3-x_2)^2+(y_3-y_2)^2}$ |
| $\overline{HF}$	|	$g$	|	$\sqrt{(x_1-x_3)^2+(y_1-y_3)^2}$ |


\begin{equation}
R = \frac{\sqrt{[(x_2-x_1)^2+(y_2-y_1)^2] \cdot [(x_3-x_2)^2+(y_3-y_2)^2] \cdot [(x_1-x_3)^2+(y_1-y_3)^2]}}{2\cdot\lvert((x_2-x_1)\cdot(y_3-y_2)) - ((y_2-y_1)\cdot(x_3-x_2))\rvert}
\label{eq:circumradius-v2}
\end{equation}

The curvature $\kappa$ (Menger curvature) of three points is simply the inverse of this circumradius and is shown in Equation \eqref{eq:CurvatureEq} [5,6,7].  Note that the absolute value in the numerator can be removed if differentiating between negative and positive curvature is desired.

<p>
\begin{align}
\kappa & = \frac{1}{R} = \frac{4A}{fgh} \notag\\
& = \frac{2\cdot\lvert((x_2-x_1)\cdot(y_3-y_2)) - ((y_2-y_1)\cdot(x_3-x_2))\rvert}{\sqrt{[(x_2-x_1)^2+(y_2-y_1)^2] \cdot [(x_3-x_2)^2+(y_3-y_2)^2] \cdot [(x_1-x_3)^2+(y_1-y_3)^2]}}
\label{eq:CurvatureEq}
\end{align}

The center of the circumcircle can also be identified.  However, the equations for defining the circumcenter's coordinates are not as simple as those for the circumradius.  From geometry, it is known that the perpendicular bisectors of the three faces of the triangle all intersect at the center of a circle which circumscribes the triangle [8].  The equations for each segment's bisector can be found from its midpoint and slope (which is simply the inverse of the segment's slope) and are shown in Table 2.
