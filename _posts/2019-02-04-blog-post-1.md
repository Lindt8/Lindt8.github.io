 <!--  Presented in the document below is a concise summary of the methodology used to fit a circle to any three 2D Cartesian points (non-collinear and distinct), determining its radius and center, and its relation to the curvature of a portion of a curve consisting of those three points.  Explicit equations solely dependent on the coordinates of the three points are provided for all of these quantities too.  Functions written in Python to calculate these values are also provided. -->

This work succinctly details the procedures involved in determining the curvature of three arbitrary two-dimensional points and the radius and center of the circle which circumscribes the triangle formed by these points.  Explicit equations solely a function of the Cartesian coordinates of the three points are provided for these values.

A circle can be fit to any three distinct and non-collinear Cartesian points $F$, $G$, and $H$ with coordinates of \((x_1,y_1)\), \((x_2,y_2)\), and \((x_3,y_3)\), respectively.  Non-collinearity can be proven in a variety of ways.  Since the area of the triangle formed by these three points will prove useful later, it can be calculated now, and a non-zero area proves the non-collinearity of the triplet of points.
