### THIS ARTICLE IS A WORK IN PROGRESS
----


If you ever find yourself needing to control the sync status of a OneDrive or iCloud for Windows file from a batch file or CMD, it is fortunately quite straightforward with ATTRIB.exe built into Windows ([comprehensive documentation here](https://ss64.com/nt/attrib.html)).  For us, we are only concerned with three particular attributes (with their `attrib` flags in parenthesis): Offline (`O`), Pinned (`P`), and Unpinned (`U`).  

In CMD, just using the `attrib` command without flags (e.g., `attrib filename.txt`) prints the file's current attributes and path.  By adding flags with a plus/minus (`+`/`-`) between `attrib` and the filename, the file's individual attributes are changed and toggled on/off (True/False). Putting a plus before the flag tells it to set that attribute to True (e.g., `+P`)  while a minus sign sets it to false (e.g., `-P`). Each of the various icons indicating sync status of a file corresponds to some combination of these flags being enabled or disabled:

<br />

| Icon | Attributes | Set with | Explanation |
| -------- | ----------- | --------- | --------- |
| <div style="text-align: center;"><img src="/files/icon_Blue-cloud.png"></div> | `O  U` | `+U` | "Only available online" files, in the cloud only and not locally available |
| <div style="text-align: center;"><img src="/files/icon_Solid-green-circle.png"></div> | `P` | `+P` | "Always keep on this device" files, locally available and will be kept downloaded |
| <div style="text-align: center;"><img src="/files/icon_Green-tick.png"></div> | ` ` | `-P` / `+P` then `-P` | "Available on this device" files, locally available (will be made online-only if space is needed) |
| <div style="text-align: center;"><img src="/files/icon_Sync-in-progress.png"></div> | `O P` / `O ` | n/a | Sync in progress (status when a file is downloading or queued to be downloaded) |

Note that the Offline (`O`) flag is something that just updates automatically and is not something we set. Setting `U` or `P` to True automatically sets the other to False, resulting in Unpinned (`U`) files being online only and Pinned (`P`) files being always locally available.  Both `U` and `P` can be set to False simultaneously, resulting in the file being locally available but not necessarily _always_ available.

In the picture below is an example with a file called IMG_6736.MOV in my iCloud Photos library.  The file goes through the following steps:
1. It begins as online only (`O U`)
2. It's then "pinned" (`+P`) to be always kept on this device
3. We check to see the attributes while queued/downloading (`O P`)
4. We check to see the attributes after the download finishes (`P`)
5. Its "pinned" status is revoked (`-P`) to remain available but not necessarily always downloaded
6. We check its attributes and see both `U` and `P` are False
7. It's finally "unpinned" (`+U`) to remove the download and make it online only again
8. And we check its attributes to verify its online only status (`O U`)

## The iCloud Photos use case

My motivation for looking into all of this in the first place revolved around iCloud Photos and its _abhorrently terrible_ performance when trying to download many files at once.  This seems like a normal use case, no?  I have just downloaded iCloud for Windows, and I want local copies of all of my iPhone's photos that are synced to iCloud.  












_As a disclaimer, I only tested all of this on iCloud for Windows files; however, iCloud for Windows works in the same way as OneDrive for fily syncing attributes.  In fact, as I was troubleshooting all of this myself, all of the resources I used referenced OneDrive._
