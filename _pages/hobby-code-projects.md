I have worked on a handful of little projects of my own to improve my own computer and/or internet experience or just as fun little projects.  Links to their respective GitHub pages and brief descriptions are provided here.

[<u>Interactive world data_map generator</u>](https://github.com/Lindt8/Interactive_world_data_map)
======
This is an easy-to-use Python tool for making custom interactive Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) world maps showing binned data, such as the example below showing the number of [Olympic medals won](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-time_Olympic_Games_medal_table) by each country.  It has a comprehensive GUI, supports data from Excel, CSV, and TSV files, and saves the GUI settings and file data for quick and easy iteration and future usage.

[<u>Wallpaper aspect ratio trimmer</u>](https://github.com/Lindt8/Wallpaper_aspect_ratio_trimmer)
======
This is a simple Python script written to take any locally stored wallpaper, determine if its aspect ratio is 16:9, and, if not, provide the user with three options where the photo has been trimmed down to a 16:9 aspect ratio to save if desired.  The paths leading to the local wallpaper folders can easily be changed as well as the desired aspect ratio too.


[<u>Letter to A4</u>](https://github.com/Lindt8/Letter_to_A4)
======
This is a very short LaTeX code which converts a letter-sized page to an A4-sized page.  This is particularly useful in situations where an A4 document is printed on letter paper (usually resulting in smaller text and white bars padding the sides of the page) and later needs to be scanned into a PDF and merged with another document of A4 sized sheets.
