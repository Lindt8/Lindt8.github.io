I have worked on a handful of little projects of my own to improve my own computer and/or internet experience.  Links to their respective GitHub pages and brief descriptions are provided here.

[<u>Wallpaper aspect ratio trimmer</u>](https://github.com/Lindt8/Wallpaper_aspect_ratio_trimmer)
======
This is a simple Python script written to take any locally stored wallpaper, determine if its aspect ratio is 16:9, and, if not, provide the user with three options where the photo has been trimmed down to a 16:9 aspect ratio to save if desired.  The paths leading to the local wallpaper folders can easily be changed as well as the desired aspect ratio too.


[<u>Letter to A4</u>](https://github.com/Lindt8/Letter_to_A4)
======
This is a very short LaTeX code which converts a letter-sized page to an A4-sized page.  This is particularly useful in situations where an A4 document is printed on letter paper (usually resulting in smaller text and white bars padding the sides of the page) and later needs to be scanned into a PDF and merged with another document of A4 sized sheets.
