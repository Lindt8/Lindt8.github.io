I have worked on a handful of little projects of my own to improve my own computer and/or internet experience.  Links to their respective GitHub pages and brief descriptions are provided here.

[Wallpaper aspect ratio trimmer](https://github.com/Lindt8/Wallpaper_aspect_ratio_trimmer)
======
This is a simple Python script written to take any locally stored wallpaper, determine if its aspect ratio is 16:9, and, if not, provide the user with three options where the photo has been trimmed down to a 16:9 aspect ratio to save if desired.  The paths leading to the local wallpaper folders can easily be changed as well as the desired aspect ratio too.
