#### Do you have any radiation-related challenges or questions you would like explored in simulation before committing to any work on the ground?

Radiation transport simulations are an excellent tool for getting answers far more quickly and easily than measurement and can be used for design (of experiments, radiation detectors, shielding, sources, etc.) and prediction/validation of measured results.

With an education and long background in nuclear engineering and armed with years of experience utilizing powerful radiation modeling tools, I seek to provide expert-informed, theoretically sound, and numerically supported solutions to a broad range of radiation-related challenges you may face.

I am an expert user and former developer of the [PHITS](https://phits.jaea.go.jp/) general-purpose particle transport code, one of the major codes of its type with thousands of users worldwide at various academic, national lab, and industry locations.  While working on the PHITS development team in Japan, I specifically led development and modernization of the [DCHAIN-PHITS](https://hratliff.com/files/DCHAIN_improvements_paper_Accepted-Manuscript.pdf) buildup, burnup, activation, and decay code coupled to PHITS.  



The types of scenarios PHITS can model and I have experience simulating include (but are not limited to):
- **Dose rate determination** in a given source and shielding scenario
- **Shielding design** to achieve a desired dose distribution / maximum dose rate
- **Detector design**, multi-hit coincident interaction detection, optimizing arrangement
- **Gamma-ray spectroscopy** including detector resolution effects
- **Neutron time-of-flight** measurements
- **Neutron/gamma ray** transmission measurements
- **Materials activation**: time-dependent nuclide inventories (+ activity and decay heat) of a sample or stucture during and after irradiation (of any irradiation schedule) by any type of radiation source, and the dose rate distributions resulting from the secondary radiation field produced by the activated materials
- **High-energy ion beam** experiments and secondary particle yields
- **Scintillator detector response** function generation
- **Radiation therapy**, using DICOM medical imaging files to model CT/PET/SPECT scans
- **Facility design**, including electromagnetic fields for guiding/bending/focusing charged beams
- **Space radiation** interactions (cosmic radiation, solar particle events)

This is by no means an exhaustive list.  PHITS can model nearly any scenario one can imagine involving radiation traversing matter and track all physical quantities of interest, something I have taken advantage of extensively in my years of using the code for solving a large variety of challenges.

If you have any inquiries, please drop me a line at [consulting@hratliff.com](mailto:consulting@hratliff.com), and we can explore how I may be able to help with any radiation-related challenges you may face.
