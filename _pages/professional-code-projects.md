I have worked on a number of professional coding projects (or relevant personal side projects).  Links to their respective web/GitHub pages and brief descriptions are provided here.

[SHAEDIT](https://github.com/Lindt8/SHAEDIT) [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.1287860.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1287860)

### Space Hadron Accelerator Experiment Data Investigation Tool
This is a Jupyter notebook for conveniently viewing and comparing the data collected from the measurements of double-differential secondary particle yields from intermediate-energy hadrons incident on thick-targets. These experimental measurements were made at the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory on the Brookhaven National Laboratory campus.  


[GCR-SpecGen](https://github.com/Lindt8/GCR_SpecGen)
======
### Galactic Cosmic Ray Spectra Generator
This is a Jupyter notebook for conveniently generating GCR spectra using the model developed by Dr. Daniel Matthiä.  More about his model can be found <u>[here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0273117712005947?via%3Dihub)</u>.  This code is a side project which is still a work in progress with more features planned.

[CLSQ2](https://github.com/Lindt8/CLSQ2)
======
### Cumming’s Least Squares (version 2)
This is a modernized version of the 1962 Cumming’s Least Squares (CLSQ) Brookhaven Decay Curve Analysis Program, written in FORTRAN IV.  The original paper on it can be read <u>[here](https://books.google.com/books?id=DZQrAAAAYAAJ&lpg=PR1&pg=PA25#v=onepage&q&f=false)</u>. CLSQ analyzes multicomponent decay curves by a least-squares procedure to iteratively identify the half-lives and abundances of the individual isotopes of a measured sample.  Its use at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) had been limited to a few very old computers due to its age and recompilation issues; only a 16-bit compiled version of the code was in use at ORNL.  To make this code more accessible, I translated the original code from FORTRAN IV into Python 3.  Additionally, I added improvements in the input and output functionalities of CLSQ, making it much more user-friendly.  The new CLSQ code is used today at ORNL and is featured in a graduate course on isotope production at the University of Tennessee.
