I have just graduated with a PhD in nuclear engineering at The University of Tennessee, Knoxville (December 2018).  I will be a postdoctoral fellow/researcher at the Japan Atomic Energy Agency headquarters starting in Spring 2019.

Research interests
======
My primary research interests pertain to space applications of nuclear engineering/physics.  Radiation protection/shielding in space environments is a large interest of mine; the design and modeling challenges presented in space are intriguing to me.

I also have an interest in radioisotope production as well as a general interest in the analyzation and presentation of large datasets.

Research experience
======
I have experience modeling the GCR and SPE induced radiation environments on the surface of Mars.  My PhD work involved conducting experiments at a hadron accelerator facility (NSRL), and my specific role pertained to neutron detection and analysis.  A significant amount of modeling and coding was involved in that project as well; I am experienced with both the MCNP and PHITS particle transport codes.

My programming language of choice is Python, though I also know Fortran, Matlab, and limited C++ (ROOT).  I also have plenty of experience working in shell environments (in both Windows and Unix-based systems).

Personal interests
======
I enjoy watching science, mathematics, technology, business, geography, history, food, and travel videos on YouTube (with a healthy dose of comedy sprinkled in too).  Additionally, I really enjoy watching documentaries; the travel genre in particular generally lends itself well to the longer format of documentaries.

I also enjoy coding as a hobby when it can be used to make something easier.  The fun projects I have made public can be seen in the Hobby Projects page of this website.  As an example, since I like to collect desktop backgrounds and am using a 16:9 aspect ratio monitor, I wrote a Python script which allows for me to easily convert a desktop background of any aspect ratio to 16:9.  I have also made several other small things to make my internet experience easier such as writing a custom HTML/CSS new tab page as well as a Windows batch script I can use to automatically launch all of the tabs I wish to check every morning.  In a way, composing this website also plays into this hobby of mine.

Like most people of my generation, I also enjoy video games.  In particular for me, I have an interest in PC gaming as well as a general interest in technology.  I built my own PC in early 2016 (right before the sharp rise in RAM and GPU prices), and the researching of parts, purchasing, and assembly were all enjoyable experiences.

Short bio
======
I entered college as an aerospace engineering major, hoping to eventually find my way into a space-related career.  However, before my freshman year had ended, I had been captivated by the energy density of nuclear fuels and some of the more innovative Gen IV reactor designs, leading me to switch to the nuclear engineering department.  

At the end of my undergraduate experience, I learned of the numerous space-related applications of nuclear engineering such as RTGs (radioisotope thermoelectric generators), nuclear thermal propulsion, and radiation protection for both astronauts and electronics.  Realizing I could apply my nuclear engineering knowledge toward my original goal of working in space-related fields, I decided to go to graduate school to pursue these interests and prepare myself for a career in these areas.  

While in grad school, I have worked on numerous space radiation modeling projects in addition to my PhD project which was itself a NASA-funded project related to space radiation shielding.
